# GEESE: Edge Computing Enabled by UAVs
GEESE is a novel UAV based system that enables the dynamic deployment of an edge computing infrastructure through the cooperation of multiple UAVs carrying cloudlets.
 
 * We quantify the performance of UAVs to transport cloudlets to the edge.
 * We demonstrate that an edge computing infrastructure can be formed through the cooperation of multiple types of UAVs via collaborative processing.
 * We develop an edge delivery model that estimates the amount of UAVs and capabilities of cloudlets required to satisfy a workload from a crowd of users.
