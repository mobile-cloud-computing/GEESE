# GEESE: Edge Computing Enabled by UAVs
GEESE is a novel UAV based system that enables the dynamic deployment of an edge computing infrastructure through the cooperation of multiple UAVs carrying cloudlets.
 
 * We quantify the performance of UAVs to transport cloudlets to the edge.
 * We demonstrate that an edge computing infrastructure can be formed through the cooperation of multiple types of UAVs via collaborative processing.
 * We develop an edge delivery model that estimates the amount of UAVs and capabilities of cloudlets required to satisfy a workload from a crowd of users.

### Portable cloudlets: Feasibility analysis ###

* Computing capacity and energy consumption of cloudlets
We analyze the computational capacity to handle the task consists of detecting prime numbers within a list of available numbers.

### GEESE design and development ###

GEESE delivers cloudlets on demand to any environment to provide edge computing services to end-applications.
